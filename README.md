# HMM-Tagger
This is a complimentary notebook to my article publised in medium [A Probabilistic Approach to POS Tagging (HMM)](https://medium.com/codex/a-probabilistic-approach-to-pos-tagging-hmm-a557f963e159)<br>
The article explains the basic probability theory that is used in POS Tagging. There are four building blocks that are used in the probabilistic POS tagging
- Markov Processes
- Chain Rule
- Baye's Theorem
- Conditional Probability

After explaining these building blocks, we use the concepts in building a Bi-Gram POS Tagger.
